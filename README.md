# Wizard101 Wiki API

## NOTE!
This API no longer works due to restrictions from the Wizard101 central site. If you can figure out either how to bypass Cloudflare's 403, or how to scrape classes from HTML (this is much easier), PLEASE make a pull request!  
Thank you, and sorry to anyone who was planning to use this.
